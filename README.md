### Intro - About the project

The back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application. The project serves as the back-end component to the WTWR React project, which focuses on the front-end.

### Description of the Project

The WTWR back-end component was built using Node.js. Express.js is the web application framework being used currently and MongoDB is used for the non-relational database aspect of the project. A module-based approach was used to keep the code structure clean and organized throughout the entire application. ES-Lint was used to guide code maintence and ensure code standards are being met

### Plans for Improvement

In future sprints, the goal is to add both front-end and back-end authorization using jwt token authorization, and connecting the front-end and back-end components of the project together to form on cohesive application.

### Running the Project

`npm run start` — to launch the server
`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature

## Testing

Before committing your code, make sure you edit the file `sprint.txt` in the root folder. The file `sprint.txt` should contain the number of the sprint you're currently working on. For ex. 12
