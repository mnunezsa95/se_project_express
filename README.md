### Intro - About the project

The back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application. The project serves as the back-end component to the WTWR React project, which focuses on the front-end.

### Description of the Project

The WTWR back-end component was built using Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB and others. Node.js serves as the main backend component of the WTWR Application. Express.js was used to create the REST API and MongoDB is used for the non-relational database, which houses information about the users and the items. A module-based approach was used to keep the code structure clean and organized throughout the entire application. ES-Lint was used to guide code maintence and ensure code standards are being met.

### Technologies Used

- Express.js : A back end web application framework for building RESTful APIs with Node.js, released as free and open-source software under the MIT License.
- Node.js : A cross-platform, open-source server environment that can run on Windows, Linux, Unix, macOS, and more.
- Mongoose : Mongoose is a MongoDB object modeling tool designed to work in an asynchronous environment. Mongoose supports Node.js.
- REST API : A REST API is an API that conforms to the design principles of the REST, or representational state transfer architectural style.
- Postman : Postman is an API Platform for developers to design, build, test and iterate their APIs.
- ESLint : ESLint is a static code analysis tool for identifying problematic patterns found in JavaScript code.

### Plans for Improvement

- Add testing scripts to the project to allow for futher scaling while maintaing and preserving existing code functionality.
- Add a search feature that allows users to look up weather in a different location and will recommend clothing based on the weather in that location. Allowing the app to be used for traveling suggestions.

### Running the Project

`npm run start` — to launch the server
`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature
